## Goal

Cluster analysis of what features best determine if an incident resulted in an arrest or not. Goal is to find interesting relationships between features and labels

## Team Contributions

- Brian Nguyen - Feature importance using a random forest model to determine what features would result in the best labels. Meant to prove that clustering is the proper way of analyzing this dataset because none of the features of predictive of the labels in question
- Jacob Palmer - Preprocessing the dataset to reduce the feature set. Turning descriptive data into quantifiable values. Has a CSV to convert descriptions into digits.
- Emmanel Amobi - Taking different features and creating clusters using K-means. This gets multiple different clustsers to present
- Zac Neuhardt - Correlating crimes across community areas. Clustering with K-means.
- Nicholas Synovic - Working on the report and presentation
